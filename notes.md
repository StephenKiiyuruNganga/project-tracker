# Webpack

- a bundling & "build orchestration" tool.
- it allows us to write modular code which is then bundled into one file. This enables the browser to make less requests to retrieve the files it requires to run your app
- it also optimizes a.k.a minifies our code (making it as small and short as possible) so that we ship smaller code that is much faster to download
- it also has other build steps for css etc that you can set up
